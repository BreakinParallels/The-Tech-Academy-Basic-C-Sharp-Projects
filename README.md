# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:

* Car Insurance

* Student Database

### **Car Insurance**
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website.  It takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic.  There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### **Student Database**
This application creates a basic Entity Framework Code-First app that creates a basic Student database and adds one student.
